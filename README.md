# OR Management App

This OR Management App is a React Native application designed to streamline the management of operating rooms (ORs), patient care in post-anesthesia care units (PACUs), regional anesthesiology, and acute pain consultations. It includes modules for monitoring current OR surgeries, managing patient consults, tracking anesthesia and surgical steps, and sending notifications to medical staff.

## Features

- **OR Dashboard**: View and monitor ongoing surgeries, with details about the current step in each procedure.
- **Regional Anesthesia Management**: Manage and assign anesthesiologists to patients requiring regional blocks.
- **Acute Pain Management**: Track patients requiring pain management consults, with a checkbox for daily rounding status.
- **PACU Tracking**: Track post-operative patients in PACU, with a ready-for-discharge indicator.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for updating clinicians on critical changes in OR or patient care status.
